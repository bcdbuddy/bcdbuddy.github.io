# Blog posts
Set of articles published either on my blog or on [dev.to](https://dev.to) some of them are still WIP (work in progress)

I always felt a little bit lazy about my blog especially when it comes to writing you quickly realize that you must have a better understanding of the subject before expecting to explain it to someone else. But lately I've been more motivated somehow just by using markdown for quickly prototyping or writing my post outline. I am just getting started and already 5 articles coming into life. I have to admit this is meanly because I do not want to repeat myself over and over again with my interns or colleagues for the exact same topic. Blog posts are to me a way to centralize it all.
