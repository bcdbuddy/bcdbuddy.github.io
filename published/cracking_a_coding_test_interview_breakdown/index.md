# Cracking a coding test interview
Coding interviews are always for me an opportunity to learn and grow which is why I wanted to share you my thought process for this one I found this morning at `letsrevolutionizetesting.com`

What I saw when I visited the page
![home page](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/4f3eplbe161ukupz47m8.png)

I revisited the application form

I wanted to know what technology was used for this

I was happy to find out it was ruby

And the hint was suggesting I should try json and I did. If you know ruby on rails then it comes to you naturally

But now I am in front of the page with this json payload. It says follow so I followed the link.
Once...
![request id json](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/szq55zdd3gjyq6ny12ws.png)

Twice...

Then I said wait...

It was too good to be true. So you have two choices:
- either you go follow one by one the id chain
- or you can just write a bit of function like I did

On the last page: The holy grale

You could have go for an iterative version with a loop


# Wrap up
I guess at RainForest they will have to make a new test since you know the answer for this one.
Overall I think it way simple enough. We just needed to take each problem one at the time and yeah every beginner can do it too.
