This is not a salary but your gains as freelance developer. You can make up to 10x more. Keep in mind that There is no max. More risks come with more gains.

Please don't confuse year experience with quality of work. You don't need 10y of experience to be good like a senior developer

Most of the time they are remote works so more time being at home.
