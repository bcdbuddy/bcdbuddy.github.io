# Content creation as source of income

This was initially addressed to teachers, professors in middle and high school. College teachers are already in content creation somehow.

- Teachers need to get their content out there. If you are reading this, I consider you also a teacher. You definitely know something that others don't. You might as well get that published in any way, shape or form (ie written, video, paid courses) 
- Product content
- You learned something so you have something to offer
