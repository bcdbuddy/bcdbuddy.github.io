# Make a living with 1000 true fans
This is not another monday motivation thing because I think if you need to be motivated to do something then you don't have to do it, you won't have the same impact like someone you have the passion doing things first thing in the morning without even thinking about it because they looove it!

It turns out you only need a thousand fans (or less) to make a living from what you doing. Imagine doing what you love and making a living out of it... I'll pause a bit to let that thought sink in.

It's possible in 90 days but most of us can't do it (yes me included)
In this post I'll share with you the results of my research of this great idea of _Kevin Kelly_
`To be successful as a creator you don't need millions of dollars, customers, fans you only need a thousand of true fans`

# Summary
- How to build a thousand of followers in 90 days

# How to build a thousand of followers in 90 days
1000 followers for 90 days
84 per week
12 per day
We need to interact with people, engage with your followers and treat them like actual people not just numbers
List a dozen of hashtag you care about and leave 10 comments/likes on each = 120 interactions
Let's say we have 10% return of engagement, this would be your 12 people a day
There you go
[insert:meme: there you go]
sound realistic right but this is just an average. The momentum would be 12 a day but at the beginning you would be only building 1 the first day, then 3, 6, 12, 25... It grows exponentially
[insert:graph exponential]
We may do this the first 6 days but for 20 straight days you need consistency, 60 days we are already finding excuses not to do that and quit because it takes dedication.
We are humans, do not have the dedication to do something consistently for 60 days


# 5 things why people engage with you
- you're interesting
- music: you have decent music or vibe that resonate with them
- cause: you have a cause they care about 
- you have great personality
- you inspire or educate

That's 5 reason why people follow you
If you do not have any of these things then you need to work on this first. Those are requirements

On your journey to 1000 people, we need to interact, ask about them, what they are working on.
Every single day ask yourself:
- how much value did you provide on your content ?
- how much effort ?

- a purpose
- content
## A purpose
