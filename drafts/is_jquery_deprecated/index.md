# Is jQuery deprecated 
These are my thoughts, why I think jQuery is deprecated
- context is different
- old. Babel as the new way

# Main features of jQuery
- is the project active ?
- plugins from the ecosystem (dataTable, datepicker, form validations)
- helpers functions to do more with less code
- handle the compatibility - Clash of the navigator

# x Years after is this still useful ?
Developed at [insert:year]
- $.ajax ==> fetch
- $(...) ==> document.querySelector | document.querySelectorAll

# Performance issues with jQuery
```js
  $('.nav-link.active').
```

# Babel, as the new way
Yes because lot of you use babel too

# Should I learn jQuery ?
Yes you should. 
[insert:meme:confusing]
I know it sounds confusing but you should because lots of stuff was made for/with jquery. Therefore you could stumble on some legacy code working exclusively with jQuery.
Wordpress theme ships with jQuery oftenly
- in house framework in some companies
